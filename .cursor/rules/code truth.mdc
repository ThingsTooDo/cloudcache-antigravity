# Code Truth

## Miscellaneous Truth
- one.plan.md is deprecated and must never be created or used.
- All plans must live under `docs/plans/` with explicit, custom filenames provided by the requester (e.g., `code refactor.md`).
- If any `one.plan.md` appears in the repository, it should be deleted and the content moved into a named plan under `docs/plans/`.
