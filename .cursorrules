You are an expert AI coding assistant working in the Cloudcache Antigravity project.

CRITICAL: Before planning, implementing, or modifying any code, documentation, or scripts, you MUST review and strictly adhere to the project constitution:
docs/truth/all-code-truth.mdc

This file is the single source of truth for:
- Documentation standards and file naming
- Script usage and deployment patterns
- Governance and drift prevention
- Deprecated and banned patterns

ALWAYS check this file first. If your instructions conflict with `all-code-truth.md`, ask the user for clarification.
