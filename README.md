## 🛑 System of Record: The Golden Path

**All developers, start here.**

For all deployment, validation, and standard operational procedures, refer to our single source of truth:

➡️ **[docs/truth/all-system-truth.md](docs/truth/all-system-truth.md)**

This document contains the "Golden Path" for all pipeline activities and is the definitive entry point for understanding how to build, deploy, and validate our software. Its guidance trumps all other documentation.
