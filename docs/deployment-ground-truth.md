## Functional Deployment Script

The primary, functional script for deploying all modules to the Preview environment is:
`bash scripts/deploy-preview.sh`

## Verified Preview URLs

The following URLs have been manually verified to be correct and functional after a successful deployment:

| Module | Verified Preview URL                                     | Status      | Notes                                    |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :---------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `app`  | `https://app-worker-preview.cloudcache.workers.dev`      | ✅ Verified | Displays "I love Cloudcache APP" message and validation badge. |
| `admin`| `https://admin-worker-preview.cloudcache.workers.dev`    | ✅ Verified | Displays "I love Cloudcache ADMIN" message and validation badge. |
| `apex` | `https://apex-worker-preview.cloudcache.workers.dev`     | ✅ Verified | Displays the main dashboard and validation badge. |

## Known Issues

- All three preview environments return a `500` error when the browser requests `/favicon.ico`. This is a non-critical issue and does not affect the functionality of the applications themselves.
